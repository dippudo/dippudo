# DIPPUDO

### Hi, I'm Dippudo üëã 
I'm a pseudonymous individual who spends most of my time in front of a computer and has a natural interest in finance. I started contributing to Bankless DAO after falling down the crypto rabbit hole in the middle of 2021. I subsequently won the Fight Club NFT Competition and am now working on numerous other projects within the DAO and The Rug News as a designer. I am now spending time diving deeper into the worlds of economics, computer science, and finance. 

Welcome to my personal website/Github. Feel free to have a look around and discover some of the things that I have been working on!
